# TerrainPatcher ExampleMod

This example mod demonstrates how to use TerrainPatcher's API to load terrain patches from a mod.

[`example.optoctreepatch`](./src/ExampleMod/example.optoctreepatch) contains the example from the patch format specification.

[`cooler-example.optoctreepatch`](./src/ExampleMod/cooler-example.optoctreepatch) contains a much cooler example created using [Reef Editor](https://github.com/eternaight/sn-terrain-edit) that adds a couple of blobs of terrain, a tunnel, and a large above-water shape.
