The files in this directory are reference assemblies generated by [refasmer](https://github.com/JetBrains/Refasmer). Some of them were publicized by [AssemblyPublicizer](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer) beforehand (indicated by the `_publicized` suffix). They contain no actual code, only method headers and class members, and serve the sole purpose of building projects that reference them.

These files are included here to allow easy and automated building of this mod, without needing to change references or copy-and-paste game files.
