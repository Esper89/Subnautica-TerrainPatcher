# Terrain Patcher v1.2.0

Terrain Patcher is a Subnautica and Below Zero library mod that allows anyone to modify the game's
terrain.

## Configuration

Patch load order can be configured in `load-order.txt`. Each line should be the name of the patch to
reorder. Load order can only be configured for patches loaded from the filesystem; to configure the
load order of patches provided directly by other mods, change the BepInEx load order of those mods.

## Repository

Terrain Patcher's source code and documentation can be found in its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Esper89/Subnautica-TerrainPatcher).
